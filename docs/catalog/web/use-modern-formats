# Leverage modern image formats

## Description
A high-resolution image can have a significant file size. The image needs to be transferred across the network and rendered on the device, which adds to the carbon footprint of your application.  Also, formats like WebP offers file sizes that are around 30% smaller than standard formats like JPEG without a quality gap..

## Solution
Leverage modern image formats like WebP and HEIC, which are smaller than standard formats like JPEG and PNG counterparts. This decreases page sizes and leads to faster downloads and less data consumption.

## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

For the SCI equation, leveraging modern image formats and web assets will impact the following:
- 'E': Leveraging modern image format would lead to faster download and less data consumption. The browser/device would take less energy to render the image. This should reduce the energy consumption of your web page, and consequently, the E number should decrease.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
